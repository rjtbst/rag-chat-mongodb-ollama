# Vector Search

A robust and extensible framework for implementing, evaluating, and scaling vector similarity search algorithms. Designed for both research and production use, this project leverages best practices in software engineering and modern Python tooling.

## Key Features

- High-performance vector similarity search (cosine, Euclidean, and more)
- Modular architecture for easy integration of new algorithms and distance metrics
- Scalable indexing and retrieval for large datasets
- Comprehensive test suite and example datasets
- Clean, well-documented codebase following industry standards

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rjtbst/vectorSearch.git
    cd vectorSearch
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run an example**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Project Layout

- `main.py` — Entry point with usage examples and CLI
- `vector_search/` — Core library modules (algorithms, indexing, utilities)
- `data/` — Sample datasets for experimentation
- `tests/` — Unit and integration tests
